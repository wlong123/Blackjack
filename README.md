This terminal based Blackjack game was built in OCaml and features a training and classic mode. In training mode there are 3 levels of varying difficulty to allow users of all experience levels to learn. The training modes will teach you everything from how to play the game to perfect betting and playing strategies to methods for effectively counting cards. In classic mode, you can specify the number of human and computer players you want to play against. Every hand you will bet a certain amount and play against the dealer. As you gain more and more chips, you will be able to buy your way into higher stakes tables with higher minimum and maximum betting amounts.

To run this game you will first need to install OCaml on your computer. After that you can simply clone the repository and type "make play" into the terminal and start playing.
